# webp-convert-concat
This project contains webp-convert concatenated to a single file as well as webp-convert concatenated to two files ([this case](https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert/blob/master/docs/v2.0/webp-on-demand/without-composer.md)).

The idea behind these "builds" is that it is easier to deal with if you are uploading via ftp.

The resulting builds are found in the `build` folder.

Note: If you are using *composer*, you do not need these builds.

This project also contains the scripts that creates these "builds" and tests.

The whole of this project used to be part of `webp-convert` but has been moved here.
